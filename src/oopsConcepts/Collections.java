	/* Drawback of array:
	 * 		1.Size cannot be increased during runtime.
	 * 		2.No way of manipulation
	 * 		3.We can group same type of data.
	 * 
	 * Generics: It's a componentwhich will help us group same type of data in to collections.
	 * 
	 * Collections:
	 * 
	 * Collection (List of an interface) & collections (List of an implementation classes)
	 * 
	 * List of interface:            
	 * 		1.List
	 * 		2.Set
	 * 		3.Map
	 * 		4.Queue
	 * 		5.DeQueue
	 * 
	 * List of an implementation classes
	 * 
	 * 		1.Arraylist
	 * 		2.Linkedlist
	 * 		3.Hashset
	 * 		4.Linked Hashset
	 * 		5.Tree Set
	 * 		6.Hash map
	 * 		7.Linked Hash map
	 * 		8.Tree map
	 * 		9.Priority queue
	 * 
	 * List:
	 * 		It's an interface which is used to store the collections of an object. List is implemented using Arraylist & linked list.
	 * 		List will store the data based on insertion order (Preserver order). So, we can retrieve the data based on index.
	 * 		List will accept the duplicate values
	 * 		List will accept the more than one Null values
	 * 		
	 * Set:
	 * 		It's an interface which is used to the store collections of an object.
	 * 		Set can be implemented using Hash set, Linked Hash set & Tree set.
	 * 		Set will not maintain the insertion or Preserverd order. So, we cannot retrieve the data based on index.
	 * 		Set will not accept the duplicate dulipcate values
	 * 		Set will accept only one null value.
	 * 
	 * Map:
	 * 		It's an interface which is used to store collections of an object.
	 * 		Map can be implemented using Hashmap, Linked hashmap & Tree map.
	 * 		Map will store the data in the form of key : value pair
	 * 		Key won't accpet duplicate & value is accept the duplicate
	 * 
	 * Queue:
	 * 		The Impementaion class for queue is prioity queue.
	 * 		Queue won't accept the null value & will not maintain the insertion order.
	 * 		It's accept the duplicate value.  (FIFO)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Diference between Array list & linked list
	 * 		Array list will store the data in the form of an index.
	 * 		Linked list will store the data in the form of an node.
	 * 		Manipulation of data in array list will impact the performance.
	 * 		Manipulation linked list will be faster.
	 * 		Arraylist is suitable for storing & retreving the data
	 * 		Linked list is suitable for manipulaion of data
	 * 
	 * Diference between Hashset & linked hashset
	 * 		Hashset will not maintain the insertion order, where as linked hashset will maintain the insertion order.
	 * 
	 * Diference between Hashset & linked hashset
	 * 		Hashset will accept one null value, where as Tree set won't accept any null value
	 * 		Hashset will not maintain the insertion order, where as Tree map will maintain the albhabetical order
	 * 
	 * Diference between Hashmap & linked hashmap
	 * 		Hashmap will not maintain the insertion order, where as linked hash map will maintain the insertion order.
	 * 
	 * Diference between Hashmap & Treehmap
	 * 		Hashmap will accept one null value, where as Tree map won't accept any null value
	 * 		Hashmap will not maintain the insertion order, where as Tree map will maintain the albhabetical order
