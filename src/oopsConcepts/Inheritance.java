		/* Using inheritance we can derive the all the properties from parent class into child class.
		 
		 * 1.Single inheritance - one parent to one child
		 * 2.Multi level inheritance - Class A -> Class B (able to access class A properties) -> Class C (able to access both class B & A properties)
		 * 3.Hierarchical - One parent & multiple child
		 * 4.Multiple inheritance - More than one parent which can be derived to one child (note: Multiple inheritance is not being supported by java because of ambiguity issue & to reduce the complexity)
		 * 5.Hybrid inheritance - combination of any other two inheritance types (Note: any form of multiple inheritance is not supported in java)
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Super Method will invoke the corresponding constructor from the parent class.
		 * Compiler will invoke the default super method implicitly to invoke default constructor from the parent class.
		 * Super method should only be invoke inside the constructor & it should be the 1st line of the constructor.
		 * 
		 * Class name implements parent1, parent 2 is possible in interface.
		 * 
		 * Class name extends Parent 1 implements parent 2, Parent 3 is possible in inreface.
